# Read.js
A JavaScript library for creating Read More links for large text articles.


Welcome to Read.js:

This is a JavaScript library for creating "Read More" links for large text articles.

To get started, download the source code and run the "index.html" file. This will show examples of how to use the class and attributes.

For further help with configuration, everything is documented in the unminimized "read.js" JavaScript file.
